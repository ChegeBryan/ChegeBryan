##### About

Hi, I'm Chege. I'm currently working on [my-django-auth](https://github.com/ChegeBryan/my-django-auth), learning about extending the default user in django web framework. Ask me about Python, Javascript, Gnome customization, Linux, the Cloud ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)) and pretty much anything random 😉.
